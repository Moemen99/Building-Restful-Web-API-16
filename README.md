## Overview
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and refresh tokens work together to provide a secure and seamless authentication experience. While JWTs handle active authentication, refresh tokens enable automatic renewal of expired JWTs without requiring user re-authentication.

## JWT Token Characteristics

- **Limited Lifespan**: JWTs are designed to expire after a short period (typically 15-30 minutes)
- **Security Focus**: Short expiration times reduce the risk window if tokens are compromised
- **Stateless**: Can be validated without checking the database
- **Authorization Header**: Typically sent with each request as a Bearer token

## The Need for Refresh Tokens

In high-security applications like banking or financial services, short JWT lifespans are crucial. However, frequent re-authentication creates a poor user experience. Refresh tokens solve this by:

1. Providing a longer-lived token for JWT renewal
2. Operating behind the scenes without user intervention
3. Maintaining security while improving user experience

    end

        Note over Client,Server: JWT Expires
        Client->>Server: Request with expired JWT
        Server->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
        Client->>Server: Send Refresh Token
        Server->>Client: New JWT
    end
```

## Token Comparison

| Characteristic | JWT | Refresh Token |
|---------------|-----|---------------|
| Typical Lifespan | 15-30 minutes | Days to months |
| Usage | Every API request | Only when JWT expires |
| Storage | Client-side | Secure storage |
| Purpose | Authentication & Authorization | JWT renewal |
| Size | Larger (contains claims) | Usually smaller |

## Implementation Example

When a user signs in, the server provides two key pieces of information:

1. **Access Token (JWT)**:
   ```json
   {
     "token": "eyJhbG....",
     "expiresIn": "30m"
   }
   ```

2. **Refresh Token**:
   ```json
   {
     "refreshToken": "xyz123...",
     "expiresIn": "7d"
   }
   ```

### Token Renewal Flow

1. Client detects JWT expiration
2. Instead of redirecting to login:
   - Sends refresh token to renewal endpoint
   - Receives new JWT
   - Updates stored tokens
   - Continues operation seamlessly

### Security Considerations

- Store refresh tokens securely
- Implement token rotation
- Maintain a token blacklist for revoked tokens
- Use HTTPS for all token transmission
- Implement refresh token expiration

## Real-World Example

Gmail and other Google services use this pattern to keep users signed in for extended periods while maintaining security:

- Short-lived access tokens for API requests
- Long-lived refresh tokens (stored securely)
- Automatic token renewal
- Users remain logged in for weeks/months
- Background renewal process is invisible to users

## Best Practices

1. **Token Storage**:
   - Never store in localStorage
   - Use HTTP-only cookies
   - Consider in-memory storage for JWTs

2. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement token rotation
   - Use secure transmission
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful expired token handling
   - Proper refresh token error responses
   - Clear user session on critical errors

4. **Performance**:
   - Implement token caching
   - Optimize renewal process
   - Monitor token usage patterns
